## Underline the Space After a Word in Microsoft Word

One way is to type a non-breaking space (Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar) at the end of the line, select from the end of word to the end of the line, and then apply underline. 

A better way is to set a tab with underline leader at the right margin, and then you can press Tab after the end of word to create an underline to the right margin. This method is better (and faster) than using underlined spaces because the underline will end evenly at the right margin, whereas underlined spaces tend to be slightly uneven at the right margin.
