## zsh

### macOS

```sh
brew options zsh
brew install zsh
brew install zsh-completions
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

If encountered this error:

```sh
chsh: /usr/local/bin/zsh: non-standard shell
```

Add `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to `/etc/shells`

### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Offline Install

[Offline install of oh-my-zsh on Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/hewerthomn/65bb351bf950470f6c9e6aba8c0c04f1)

## Operations

[Weird “jobs” behavior within zsh](http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2007/msg01243.html)

## oh-my-zsh

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Edit your new .zshrc file your home directory. You can select themes and plugins for usage in zsh. For a complete list of themes and plugins, look in the .oh-my-zsh folder in your home directory. This was installed with zsh. There is a themes folder here and a plugins folder.

To add new plugins, find this line in .zshrc:

```sh
plugins=(git)
```

I like plugins, so this is my setup:

```sh
plugins=(autojump git git-extras git-flow git-flow-avh git-hubflow git-prompt git-remote-branch gitfast github gitignore svn svn-fast-info cp brew tmux history history-substring-search terminalapp brew nanoc osx xcode zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

Optionally set `DEFAULT_USER` in `~/.zshrc` to your regular username to hide the `user@hostname` info when you’re logged in as yourself on your local machine. For example

```sh
DEFAULT_USER=taohe
```

If use brew, modify PATH

Put `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin`

Put `/usr/local/sbin` before `/usr/sbin`

## zsh-completions

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:=~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions
```

Enable it in `~/.zshrc` by adding it to your plugin list and reloading the completion:

```sh
plugins=(… zsh-completions)

# zsh-completions
autoload -U compinit && compinit
```

## zsh-syntax-highlighting

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## zsh-autosuggestions

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

### zsh-iterm-touchbar

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iam4x/zsh-iterm-touchbar.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-iterm-touchbar
```

### Powerlevel9k

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel9k
```

## zsh plugins

### Method 1, install in oh-my-zsh (recommended)

```sh
cd ${ZSH_CUSTOM1:-$ZSH/custom}/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/supercrabtree/k.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
git clone https://github.com/iam4x/zsh-iterm-touchbar.git
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git
Activate the plugin in ~/.zshrc (in last position):
plugins=( [plugins...] k zsh-completions zsh-iterm-touchbar zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Method 2, install in zsh

```sh
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
brew install zsh-history-substring-search
brew tap sambadevi/powerlevel9k
brew install powerlevel9k
more "/usr/local/opt/zsh-history-substring-search/README.md"
source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
source /usr/local/opt/zsh-history-substring-search/zsh-history-substring-search.zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### themes

[Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k)

[Themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes)

set `ZSH_THEME` in `~/.zshrc` to `"agnoster"`.

agnoster theme shows git icons but needs patched font.

Make sure you have already downloaded powerline.

```sh
fontforge -script ~/.vim/bundle/powerline/font/fontpatcher.py /System/Library/Fonts/Menlo.ttc
```

If you prefer the old Monaco font, you should type

```sh
fontforge -script ~/.vim/bundle/powerline/font/fontpatcher.py /System/Library/Fonts/Monaco.dfont
```

For macOS, Fonts are located in '/Library/Fonts/' or '/System/Library/Fonts/'.

Menlo is the new default font in Mavericks.

[OS X: Fonts included with Mavericks](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5944)

After running this command, 'Monaco for Powerline.otf' or 'Menlo Regular for Powerline.otf' is generated. Install the font by double-clicking the font file in Finder and click “Install this font” from the preview window.

[Font patching](https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html#font-patching)

Change iTerm fonts in

iTerm -> Preferences... -> Profiles -> (Select a profile) -> Text -> ChangeFont -> Menlo Regular for Powerline
