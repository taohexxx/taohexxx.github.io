## macOS

### Install Python

```sh
brew install python3
which python3
ll /usr/local/bin/python3
brew install python2
which python2
ll /usr/local/bin/python2
```

### Use Pip

Upgrade Pip

```sh
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip2 install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Install packages

```sh
pip3 install <package>
pip2 install <package>
```

Install packages to user path

```sh
pip3 install --user mercurial
pip install --user mercurial
```

This should result in the hg script being installed in `$HOME/.local/bin/hg` and the rest of the hg package in `$HOME/.local/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages/`.

The location on macOS was changed from `$HOME/.local` to `$HOME/Library/Python`
